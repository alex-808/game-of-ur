-center dice div
-center game board
-move columns closer together
-make board responsive

Refactoring:
- create player class instead of 2 separate objects
- change everything to camelCase
- add singles event listeners to board and each player's pieces instead of many
- create dice object
    -rollDice method
    -diceValue1
    -diceValue2
    -calcRollVal
    -rollVal



how do I make set the pathing?
we need to know:
- which player has access to which tiles
- in which order the tiles should be moved through

we could have it so that all the tiles of a certain player have the player color class
then we could 

i could just grab all the tiles and then divy them up

ideally the paths would just be in order in an array

<div class="white grey path-1">
